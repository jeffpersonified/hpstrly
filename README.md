Hpstrly
==========

Hpstrly is an url shortner with hipster flair â€“ style your links with the most obscure of hipster terminology. Dig it.

This was the first rails app I deployed while going through [Dev Bootcamp](http://devbootcamp.com/) Fall 2012. It integrates user authentication and the use of sessions to maintain urls for anonymous users.
